# SingaHai Travel Buddy
## üìå Purpose & Background

The goal of this project is to create an app that helps travelers enjoy a smoother and more fun trip between Singapore and Shanghai. Modern people are too busy to plan, so the app should handle food, lodging, sightseeing, and transport all at once.
The app should feel smart, trendy, and intuitive‚Äîlike a personal travel soulmate. Expansion to other cities is possible in the future.

## üßæ  First Draft Thoughts

- 	We want to make a travel app that helps people plan their trips, including where to stay and what to eat. Everyone is busy these days, so the app must be easy to use.
- The app should make people want to travel when they open it. Design must feel inspiring. Colors should be bright, youthful but not childish.
- There should be a schedule feature. Users can choose things or we can plan everything for them. So they don‚Äôt have to think too much.
- There should be a quiz, like a personality test. Then they know what kind of traveler they are and we can suggest better things.
- Food is very important too. Some people are vegetarian, halal, or don‚Äôt eat spicy. Restaurants must be clean, photogenic, and not expensive.
- Hotels should be close to the attractions, or traveling will be tiring. Price should be okay. Photos must look comfortable. Not noisy.
- Must have maps. Otherwise people will get lost. Navigation would be nice. Show distance and time.
- The app should have everything, but not be too complicated. Preferably, everything is on one page. Slide and done.
- The most important thing is that the app feels convenient, modern, fun‚Äîlike a friend helping you travel.

## üí°  Notes
- I‚Äôm not really sure how to write ‚Äúrequirements,‚Äù but we just want the app to be good-looking, fun, and useful. Everyone‚Äôs excited.
- Fewer buttons are better, but also can‚Äôt have too few functions.
- Recommend stuff, but let people change it too. Otherwise they keep asking customer service.
- Oh right, can we add weather? Don‚Äôt plan too many outdoor things if it‚Äôs raining.
- Maybe some reminders, like ‚Äúmake reservation for tomorrow‚Äù or ‚Äúwake up early for tour.‚Äù
