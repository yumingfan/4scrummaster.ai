# SingaHai Travel Buddy
## 📌 目的与背景 | Purpose & Background
本工程目的是做一款帮助旅客在新加坡和上海自由行时变得更方便的 App。现代人都很忙，没空做功课，所以这个 App 会一次搞定吃住玩交通，让行程变得简单又有趣。	
这款 App 要看起来智慧、时尚、要让人一打开就觉得好用，像是他们的旅游灵魂伴侣。未来也可能拓展到其他城市。	
The goal of this project is to create an app that helps travelers enjoy a smoother and more fun trip between Singapore and Shanghai. Modern people are too busy to plan, so the app should handle food, lodging, sightseeing, and transport all at once.
The app should feel smart, trendy, and intuitive—like a personal travel soulmate. Expansion to other cities is possible in the future.

## 🧾 初步想法 First Draft Thoughts

- 我们想做一个旅游的App，主要是可以帮助大家规划行程，还有住哪里跟吃什么。因为大家都很忙，所以这个App要简单好用。	
We want to make a travel app that helps people plan their trips, including where to stay and what to eat. Everyone is busy these days, so the app must be easy to use.
- App 要让人一看到就想出国，设计要有感觉，最好色彩明亮，看起来年轻但不要幼稚。	
The app should make people want to travel when they open it. Design must feel inspiring. Colors should be bright, youthful but not childish.
- 行程要有安排功能，使用者可以点进去选，他也可以自己改，或者全部都帮他排好，这样就不用想。	
There should be a schedule feature. Users can choose things or we can plan everything for them. So they don’t have to think too much.
- 最好有测验，像做心理测验，这样他们就知道自己适合什么。这样我们也比较好推荐东西给他。	
There should be a quiz, like a personality test. Then they know what kind of traveler they are and we can suggest better things.
- 吃的部分也要很重要，不然很多人会不开心。要有吃素的、清真的、还有不能吃辣的。餐厅要乾净好拍照，不要太贵。	
Food is very important too. Some people are vegetarian, halal, or don’t eat spicy. Restaurants must be clean, photogenic, and not expensive.
- 住宿的话，地点要近，不然搭车会累。价钱要合理。照片要看起来舒服。也不能太吵。	
Hotels should be close to the attractions, or traveling will be tiring. Price should be okay. Photos must look comfortable. Not noisy.
- 地图一定要有。不然会迷路。有导航最好，或是能显示距离和时间。	
Must have maps. Otherwise people will get lost. Navigation would be nice. Show distance and time.
- 这个App最好什么都有，但又不要太复杂。可以一页看到很多东西。最好是滑一滑就安排好了。	
The app should have everything, but not be too complicated. Preferably, everything is on one page. Slide and done.
- 最重要是这个App让人觉得很方便，很新，很有趣，用起来像朋友一样。	
The most important thing is that the app feels convenient, modern, fun—like a friend helping you travel.

## 💡 备注 Notes
- 我其实也不是很懂怎么写需求啦，不过我们就是希望大家觉得这个App好看、好玩、好用。大家都很期待。	
I’m not really sure how to write “requirements,” but we just want the app to be good-looking, fun, and useful. Everyone’s excited.
- 最好设计一点不要太多按钮，但也不能没有功能。	
Fewer buttons are better, but also can’t have too few functions.
- 最好可以推荐行程，也让人可以自己改，不然大家都问客服。	
Recommend stuff, but let people change it too. Otherwise they keep asking customer service.
- 啊对了，有没有可能加上天气功能？如果下雨就不要排太多户外。	
Oh right, can we add weather? Don’t plan too many outdoor things if it’s raining.
- 最好也有一个小提醒功能，例如明天要去的地方要先预约、或早点起床。	
Maybe some reminders, like “make reservation for tomorrow” or “wake up early for tour.”
