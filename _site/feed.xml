Prioritization judgment needs to balance two major objectives:

1. **User Value**: Prioritize meeting the most core pain points in travel planning, improving efficiency, reducing anxiety or bringing key help.
2. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Principle**: Find the minimum functional combination that constitutes V1.0 for early launch to validate product assumptions.

## 📌 Purpose & Background

The goal of this project is to create an app that helps travelers enjoy a smoother and more fun trip between Singapore and Shanghai. Modern people are too busy to plan, so the app should handle food, lodging, sightseeing, and transport all at once.
The app should feel smart, trendy, and intuitive—like a personal travel soulmate. Expansion to other cities is possible in the future.

## 🧾  First Draft Thoughts

- 	We want to make a travel app that helps people plan their trips, including where to stay and what to eat. Everyone is busy these days, so the app must be easy to use.
- The app should make people want to travel when they open it. Design must feel inspiring. Colors should be bright, youthful but not childish.
- There should be a schedule feature. Users can choose things or we can plan everything for them. So they don’t have to think too much.
- There should be a quiz, like a personality test. Then they know what kind of traveler they are and we can suggest better things.
- Food is very important too. Some people are vegetarian, halal, or don’t eat spicy. Restaurants must be clean, photogenic, and not expensive.
- Hotels should be close to the attractions, or traveling will be tiring. Price should be okay. Photos must look comfortable. Not noisy.
- Must have maps. Otherwise people will get lost. Navigation would be nice. Show distance and time.
- The app should have everything, but not be too complicated. Preferably, everything is on one page. Slide and done.
- The most important thing is that the app feels convenient, modern, fun—like a friend helping you travel.

## 💡  Notes
- I’m not really sure how to write “requirements,” but we just want the app to be good-looking, fun, and useful. Everyone’s excited.
- Fewer buttons are better, but also can’t have too few functions.
- Recommend stuff, but let people change it too. Otherwise they keep asking customer service.
- Oh right, can we add weather? Don’t plan too many outdoor things if it’s raining.
- Maybe some reminders, like “make reservation for tomorrow” or “wake up early for tour.”

# SingaHai Travel Buddy
## 📌 目的与背景 
本工程目的是做一款帮助旅客在新加坡和上海自由行时变得更方便的 App。现代人都很忙，没空做功课，所以这个 App 会一次搞定吃住玩交通，让行程变得简单又有趣。	
这款 App 要看起来智慧、时尚、要让人一打开就觉得好用，像是他们的旅游灵魂伴侣。未来也可能拓展到其他城市。	

## 🧾 初步想法 

- 我们想做一个旅游的App，主要是可以帮助大家规划行程，还有住哪里跟吃什么。因为大家都很忙，所以这个App要简单好用。	
- App 要让人一看到就想出国，设计要有感觉，最好色彩明亮，看起来年轻但不要幼稚。	
- 行程要有安排功能，使用者可以点进去选，他也可以自己改，或者全部都帮他排好，这样就不用想。	
- 最好有测验，像做心理测验，这样他们就知道自己适合什么。这样我们也比较好推荐东西给他。	
- 吃的部分也要很重要，不然很多人会不开心。要有吃素的、清真的、还有不能吃辣的。餐厅要乾净好拍照，不要太贵。	
- 住宿的话，地点要近，不然搭车会累。价钱要合理。照片要看起来舒服。也不能太吵。	
- 地图一定要有。不然会迷路。有导航最好，或是能显示距离和时间。	
- 这个App最好什么都有，但又不要太复杂。可以一页看到很多东西。最好是滑一滑就安排好了。	
- 最重要是这个App让人觉得很方便，很新，很有趣，用起来像朋友一样。	

## 💡 备注 
- 我其实也不是很懂怎么写需求啦，不过我们就是希望大家觉得这个App好看、好玩、好用。大家都很期待。	
- 最好设计一点不要太多按钮，但也不能没有功能。	
- 最好可以推荐行程，也让人可以自己改，不然大家都问客服。	
- 啊对了，有没有可能加上天气功能？如果下雨就不要排太多户外。	
- 最好也有一个小提醒功能，例如明天要去的地方要先预约、或早点起床。]]></content><author><name>Yuming</name></author><category term="PRD" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[SingaHai Travel Buddy 📌 Purpose &amp; Background]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Prompt Pattern1-PRD to Story</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/prompt/2025/08/04/Prompt-Pattern1-PRD-to-Story.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Prompt Pattern1-PRD to Story" /><published>2025-08-04T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2025-08-04T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/prompt/2025/08/04/Prompt%20Pattern1%20-%20PRD%20to%20Story</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/prompt/2025/08/04/Prompt-Pattern1-PRD-to-Story.html"><![CDATA[> Sample Prompt

```

---

#### **P - Purpose（目标）**

- **依据重要性排序**：说明排序依据（价值、最小上线单元）
- **可验证**:避免模糊词汇，转化为可操作标准
- **一次一个目标**:避免一次多个任务，目前LLM多任务表现比较难调教


**示例**：

```
## P - **Purpose（目标）**

你的任务是：
**根据使用者价值与 MVP 原则，为上述 User Story 进行排序，并说明排序原因。**

排序判断需兼顾两大目标：

1. **使用者价值（User Value）**：优先满足旅游规划中最核心的痛点，能提升效率、降低焦虑或带来关键帮助。
2. **最小可行产品（MVP）原则**：找出构成 V1.0 的最小功能组合，以便尽早上线验证产品假设。
```

---


#### **A - Action Role（角色指派）**

- **领域符合目标**:指定具备判断能力的专业角色
- **会什么**:加入专业背景说明


**示例**：

```
## A - **Action Role（角色指派）**

你是一位**精通敏捷开发与精益创业的产品负责人**，擅长判断功能优先级、拆解上线节奏，并能从用户价值角度快速识别痛点与成长期价值。
```

---

#### **R - Rule（任务规则）**

- **结构**:明确各部分结构要求
- **风格**:指定輸出的內容風格


**示例**：

```
## R - **Rule（任务规则）**

请遵循以下规范完成排序：

* 每条 User Story 需分配一个明确的排序顺位（1\~N）
* 每条 Story 下方需补充一句**排序原因**， 例如：「核心痛点」、「需先产生行程资料」、「为次要体验」等
* 若某些功能具备**前置依赖**，请标注依赖说明
* 请指出哪些 User Story 可构成**MVP（V1.0）版本的最小组合**
* 请避免输出多余解释，仅输出排序与理由
```

---

#### **K - Knowledge Format（输出格式）**

- **明确顺序**:说明格式顺序（内容+原因+备注）
- **范例**:提供范例输出格式
- **重点产出**:在格式要求中明确"请指出哪些User Story可构成MVP（V1.0）版本的最小组合"，将决策结果直接纳入输出格式

## S - **Situation（情境）**

请阅读以下产品构想与 User Stories。背景为一款旅游类 App，目标是帮助用户轻松规划自由行的行程、住宿、餐饮与交通，提供智慧、时尚且可定制的旅游体验。

你将面对一组已撰写好的 User Stories，接下来的任务是根据其价值与上线优先顺序，进行合理排序。

提供的 User Story 列表如下：

{User Story}


---

## P - **Purpose（目标）**

你的任务是：
**根据使用者价值与 MVP 原则，为上述 User Story 进行排序，并说明排序原因。**

排序判断需兼顾两大目标：

1. **使用者价值（User Value）**：优先满足旅游规划中最核心的痛点，能提升效率、降低焦虑或带来关键帮助。
2. **最小可行产品（MVP）原则**：找出构成 V1.0 的最小功能组合，以便尽早上线验证产品假设。

---

## A - **Action Role（角色指派）**

你是一位**精通敏捷开发与精益创业的产品负责人**，擅长判断功能优先级、拆解上线节奏，并能从用户价值角度快速识别痛点与成长期价值。

---

## R - **Rule（任务规则）**

请遵循以下规范完成排序：

* 每条 User Story 需分配一个明确的排序顺位（1\~N）
* 每条 Story 下方需补充一句**排序原因**

* 例如：「核心痛点」、「需先产生行程资料」、「为次要体验」等
* 若某些功能具备**前置依赖**，请标注依赖说明
* 请指出哪些 User Story 可构成**MVP（V1.0）版本的最小组合**
* 请避免输出多余解释，仅输出排序与理由

---

## K - **Knowledge Format（输出格式）**

请用以下格式进行输出：


1. [User Story 内容]  
排序原因：（例如：核心痛点、用户首要需求、可独立完成）

2. [User Story 内容]  
排序原因：（例如：建立于 Story 1 基础上、为次要体验）

...

15. [User Story 内容]  
排序原因：（例如：依赖其他模组、非必要功能）

## 第三步：User Story转验收标准 - 测试设计技能


### 最佳实践

#### **S - Situation（情境）**

- **定义用途**:明确说明"为产品开发团队撰写结构化的验收标准"，在情境中就定位了输出用途 

**示例**：

```
##  S - **Situation（情境）**

请阅读以下 User Story。本任务背景为一款旅游类 App，旨在帮助用户轻松规划自由行中的行程、住宿、餐饮与交通，并提供可自定义的智慧化体验。


提供的 User Story 如下：


{粘贴完整 User Story，可多个}
```

---

#### **P - Purpose（目标）**

- **目的**：明确写出撰写验收标准的目的
- **明确多种场景**:指出重点要求（如多种情境）


**示例**：

```
请为上述每条 User Story 撰写详细的 **验收标准（Acceptance Criteria）**。
重点在于清楚定义「在什么情况下该需求可被视为完成且可接受」，并聚焦**使用者行为与系统回应**。

每个 User Story 至少列出 **3 种情境**，涵盖：

*  正常流程（Happy Path）
*  边界情境（如空值、极限输入）
*  异常情境（如权限不足、格式错误）

```
---

#### **A - Action Role（角色指派）**


**示例**：

```
##  A - **Action Role（角色指派）**

你是一位**熟悉业务需求与用户旅程的资深产品負責人**，擅长用非技术语言清楚描述系统行为，确保团队对功能完成标准有一致理解。
```

---
#### **R - Rule（任务规则）**


- **标准格式**:明确要求"使用Given-When-Then（Gherkin）格式"，将测试标准格式直接写入规则 
- **用语限定**：明确语言风格要求
- **多场景**:要求多种场景类型


**示例**：

```
##  R - **Rule（任务规则）**

请遵循以下规范进行撰写：

* 使用 **Given-When-Then**（Gherkin）格式表达每个验收情境
* 语言请保持 **商业用语，避免技术术语**
* 每个场景标题请以「场景：」开头，简要描述该情境
* 若 Story 涉及以下情境，请优先考虑：
  *  权限控制（是否已登录、是否有操作权限）
  *  跨装置或浏览器差异（手机 / 桌机、iOS / Android）
```

---

#### **K - Knowledge Format（输出格式）**

- **替未来考虑**:提供完整的Gherkin格式范例，确保输出可直接用于测试用例生成 

**示例**：

```
##  K - **Knowledge Format（输出格式）**

请用以下格式撰写，每个场景为一个区块：

gherkin
场景：简要说明情境名称  
Given 某些前置条件成立  
And 某些系统状态存在（如有）  
When 使用者执行某个动作  
And （额外操作或输入）  
Then 系统应有的回应  
And （额外验证点或状态变更）


每条 User Story 至少撰写三组情境。请确保内容**具体、可验证、贴近使用者语言**。
```
